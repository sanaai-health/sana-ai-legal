# Privacy Policy for Sana AI

*Last updated: April 27, 2025*

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

At Sana AI, we believe your health data belongs to you. We've built our app with privacy at its core, ensuring your personal information remains private and secure.

## What We DON'T Do

- We DO NOT collect, store, or access your personal health data on any servers
- We DO NOT upload your health information to the cloud
- We DO NOT share or sell your data with third parties
- We DO NOT track your health metrics remotely
- We DO NOT use encryption for local storage (all data is stored in standard Hive boxes on your device)

## How Your Data is Stored

### Local Storage Only
All your health information (medications, allergies, symptoms, and health check-ins) is stored exclusively on your device using local storage (Hive database). This means:

- Your data never leaves your phone
- Only you can access your health information through the app
- If you delete the app, all locally stored data is permanently removed
- No backups are made to cloud services
- Data is stored in standard format without encryption

### Authentication Data
We only collect minimal information required for app functionality:
- Email address (for authentication only)
- Subscription status (to enable premium features)
- Basic usage analytics (app crashes, performance metrics)

This data is securely managed through Firebase Authentication and is never linked to your health information.

## AI Interactions

When you use our AI health chat:
- Conversations are processed in real-time using Google Gemini API
- No conversation history is stored on our servers
- Image analysis is performed without retaining the images
- AI responses are generated based on your immediate query only
- Health context is generated temporarily for each session and immediately discarded

## Your Control and Responsibility

- You have complete control over your data
- You may choose to share information with healthcare providers or others at your discretion
- We are not responsible for data you choose to share outside the app
- You can request data deletion by filling out our data deletion form: https://forms.gle/5U8mjWiL36Cb4txb7
- You can immediately delete all your data by uninstalling the app

## Data Deletion

You can delete your data in two ways:
1. **Immediate deletion**: Uninstall the app from your device
2. **Account deletion**: Submit a request through our data deletion form at https://forms.gle/5U8mjWiL36Cb4txb7

Upon receiving your deletion request, we will:
- Remove your authentication data from Firebase
- Cancel any active subscriptions
- Delete any associated account information

Note: Since health data is stored only on your device, uninstalling the app immediately removes all health information.

## Third-Party Services

We use the following services with minimal data sharing:
- Firebase Authentication (for login and account management)
- Google Gemini API (for AI features - processes data without storage)
- Payment processors (Apple App Store and Google Play Store for subscriptions)
- Firebase Analytics (for app performance monitoring)

These services have their own privacy policies and handle only the minimum data required for their functions.

## Medical Disclaimer

Sana AI is not a medical application and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. While users can store health-related information, we:
- Do not provide medical advice
- Do not diagnose conditions
- Do not prescribe treatments
- Recommend consulting healthcare professionals for medical concerns
